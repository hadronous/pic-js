# Examples

All examples are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the test runner,
but `@hadronous/pic` can be used with JavaScript and any other testing runner, such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v20.x/docs/api/test.html), [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

## Setup

- Install [bun](https://bun.sh/) OR install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - Replace `bun` with `pnpm` in any subsequent commands if you choose to use `pnpm`.
- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  bun i
  ```
